Simply name the tunnel and select your source machine os.</p> <p></p> <p>Once you have the screen output of the two code snippets, you will select the one on the left to install, and configure the service, or if you have the <code>cloudflared.service</code> already installed then you will use the snippet on the right. These are bash commands that you run in turn on the same host as your service in this case the same host as our \"Sonarr\" service.

This will be fine for most applications that you do not want to protect with 2FA, for services like self hosted Plex / Jellyfin instances. However you will have some some other services which you dont want the general public to be able to browse to. This is where the <code>Cloudflare Zero Trust Applications</code> come in very handy.</p> <p></p> <p>This one looks complicated but is very simple. Name the application, then set the <code>Subdomain</code> and <code>Domain</code> to be exactly the same as your <code>Public Hostname</code> setup that we previously configured. Following that you can optionally add a custom logo if you wish but it isn't of much use unless you plan to use the CF dashboard.

A bridged network shares the real network interface of the host computer with other VMs to connect to the outside network. Therefore each VM can bind directly to any available IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, just like a physical computer would do.</p> <p>By default KVM setups a private virtual bridge, so that all VMs can communicate with each another, within the host computer internally. It provides its own subnet and DHCP to configure the guest\u2019s network and uses NAT to access the host network.</p> <p>The KVM default network <code>virbr0</code> uses <code>192.168.122.1/24</code> IP address. All the VMs will use an IP address in the <code>192.168.122.0/24</code> IP range and the host OS will be reachable at <code>192.168.122.1</code>. You should be able to ssh into the host OS (at <code>192.168.122.1</code>) from inside the guest OS and use scp to copy files back and forth.</p> <p>It is OK if you only access the VMs inside from the host itself. However we can't access the VMs from other remote systems in the hosts attached network.</p> <p>Because they use different IP range i.e. <code>10.0.180.0/24</code> in my case. In order to access the VMs from other remote hosts, we must setup a public bridge that runs on the host network and uses whatever external DHCP server is on the host network.</p> <p>To put this in layman terms, we are going to make all VMs to use the same subnet used by the host system.</p> <p>Before setting up a public bridged network, we should disable Netfilter for performance and security reasons. Netfilter is currently enabled on bridges by default.</p> <p>To disable netfilter, create a file called <code>/etc/sysctl.d/bridge.conf</code></p>  bash <pre><code>sudo nano /etc/sysctl.d/bridge.conf\n</code></pre> <p>Add the following lines:</p>  bash <pre><code>net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables=0\nnet.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=0\nnet.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables=0\n</code></pre> <p>Save and close the file.</p> <p>Then create another file called <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/99-bridge.rules</code></p>  bash <pre><code>sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-bridge.rules\n</code></pre> <p>Add the following line:</p>  bash <pre><code>ACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"module\", KERNEL==\"br_netfilter\", RUN+=\"/sbin/sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/bridge.conf\"\n</code></pre> <p>This will set the necessary flags to disable netfilter on bridges at the appropriate place in system start-up. Save and close the file. </p> <p>Reboot your system to take effect these changes.</p> <p>Next, we should disable the default networking that KVM installed for itself.</p> <p>Find the name of KVM default network interfaces using \"ip link\" command:</p>  bash <pre><code>ip link\n</code></pre> <p>Sample output:</p>  bash <pre><code>1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000\nlink/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00\n2: enp0s3: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000\nlink/ether 08:00:27:8a:52:94 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n3: enp0s8: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000\nlink/ether 08:00:27:10:7c:c1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n4: enp0s9: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000\nlink/ether 08:00:27:5d:61:28 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n5: virbr0: &lt;NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 100    0\nlink/ether 52:54:00:1f:a2:e7 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n6: virbr0-nic: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel master virbr0 state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000\nlink/ether 52:54:00:1f:a2:e7 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n</code></pre> <p>As you see in the above output, the entries <code>virbr0</code> and <code>virbr0-nic</code> are the KVM networks.</p> <p>Let us remove the default KVM network with command:</p>  bash <pre><code>virsh net-destroy default\n</code></pre> <p>Sample output:</p>  bash <pre><code>Network default destroyed\nUndefine the default network with command: virsh net-undefine default\n</code></pre> <p>Now run the command it displayed above</p>  bash <pre><code>virsh net-undefine default\n</code></pre> <p>Sample output:</p>  bash <pre><code>Network default has been undefined\n</code></pre> Tip <p>If the above commands didn't work for any reason, you can use these commands to disable and undefine KVM default network.</p>  bash <pre><code>sudo ip link delete virbr0 type bridge\nsudo ip link delete virbr0-nic\n</code></pre> <p>Now run <code>ip link</code> again to verify if the virbr0 and virbr0-nic interfaces are actually deleted.</p> <p>$ ip link=== \" bash\"     <pre><code>1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000\nlink/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00\n2: enp0s3: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000\nlink/ether 08:00:27:8a:52:94 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n3: enp0s8: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000\nlink/ether 08:00:27:10:7c:c1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n4: enp0s9: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000\nlink/ether 08:00:27:5d:61:28 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n</code></pre></p> <p>See?

Most wireless interlaces do not support bridging. Always use wired network interfaces for seamless connectivity!</p> <p>To create a network bridge in host, edit <code>/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml</code> file and add the bridge details.</p> <p>Here is the default contents of the <code>00-installer-config.yaml</code> file in my Ubuntu 20.04 LTS server.</p>  bash <p><pre><code>cat /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml\n</code></pre> <pre><code># This is the network config written by 'subiquity'\nnetwork:\nethernets:\nenp3s0:\ndhcp4: false\naddresses:\n- 10.0.180.4/24\ngateway4: 10.0.180.1\nnameservers:\naddresses:\n- 10.0.180.1\n- 172.64.36.1\nsearch: []\nversion: 2\nrenderer: NetworkManager\n</code></pre></p> <p>As you see, I have a wired network interface namely enp3s0 in my Ubuntu server.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Before editing this file, backup your existing <code>/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml</code> file.</p>  bash <pre><code>sudo cp /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml{,.backup}\n</code></pre> <p>Then edit the default config file using your favorite editor, for me this is nano.</p>  bash <pre><code>sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml\n</code></pre> <p>Add/modify it like below you should also note that the subnet for you will likely differ from mine so replace the below values that matches with your network:</p>  bash <pre><code># This is the network config written by 'subiquity'\nnetwork:\n  ethernets:\n    enp3s0:\n      dhcp4: false\nbridges:\n    br0:\n      interfaces: [ enp3s0 ]\naddresses: [10.0.180.4/24]\ngateway4: 10.0.180.1\n      mtu: 1500\nnameservers:\n        addresses: [10.0.180.1,1.1.1.1]\nparameters:\n        stp: true\nforward-delay: 4\ndhcp4: no\n      dhcp6: no\n  version: 2\nrenderer: NetworkManager\n</code></pre> <p>Here, the bridge network interface <code>br0</code> is attached to host's network interface <code>enp0s3</code>.

To activate cockpit you should run the below commands, included in these are the additional addons for virtual machine management and package updates etc.</p>  bash <pre><code>sudo apt install cockpit cockpit-machines cockpit-packagekit -y\nsudo systemctl enable cockpit\nsudo systemctl start cockpit\n</code></pre> <p><code>cockpit</code> will no be accessible on <code>ip-address-of-machine:9090</code> via a webbrowser.</p> <p>Now once you have installed cockpit you are ready to deploy your first virtual machine!</p>  bash <p>Important Information</p> <p>For the command <code>virt-install</code> there are a lot of arguments that we will be adding, here is a brief explanation of these arguments, ensure you change the values to suit your needs.</p> <p><code>--name</code> - Is the name of the virtual machine you wish to create.</p> <p><code>--ram</code> - Is the amount of RAM in MB's that you want to allocate to the VM.</p> <p><code>--vcpus</code> - Is the amount of CPU threads that you want to allocate to the VM.</p> <p><code>--cpu</code> - Expose the host CPUs configuration to the guest. This enables the guest to take advantage of many of the host CPUs features (better performance), but may cause issues if migrating the guest to a host without an identical CPU.</p> <p><code>--hvm</code> - Requests the use of full virtualization, if both para &amp; full virtualization are available on the host. This parameter may not be available if connecting to a Xen hypervisor on a machine without hardware virtualization support. This parameter is implied if connecting to a <code>QEMU</code> based hypervisor.</p> <p><code>--disk path=</code> - Is the path to the location in which you wish to stor the VM's hard disk.</p> <p><code>,size</code> - Is the size of the VM's hard disk in GB's.</p> <p><code>--cdrom</code> - Is the path to the ISO file you wish to install the VM OS from.</p> <p><code>--network</code> - Is the network that you wan to put the VM on, in our case the bridge network we created earlier.</p> <p><code>--graphics</code> - Specifies the graphical display configuration. This does not configure any virtual hardware, just how the guest's graphical display can be accessed.</p> <p><code>--autorestart</code> -  Set the <code>autostart</code> flag for the VM. This causes the VM to be started on host boot up / reboot.</p> <pre><code>sudo virt-install --name VM-NAME-HERE --ram=4096 --vcpus=4 --cpu host --hvm --disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/VM-NAME-HERE,size=50 --cdrom /path/to/iso/vm-os.iso --network bridge=br0 --graphics vnc --autostart\n</code></pre> <p>This will now execute and install your VM, the above command in my case was used to install a <code>Windows 10</code> VM, which needs user input to install unless you made youe own auto install image. So to setup the VM myself, I use the aforementioned application <code>cockpit</code>.</p> <p>Now head over to Cockpit (<code>http://host-ip-address:9090</code>) login with your user, from the main page you will notice a tab for <code>Virtual Machines</code> and from there drop down the menu of your VM. You will see a <code>Consoles</code> tab. Select this and you should see the output of the VM's console, allowing you to view and setup the VM. Once this is done you can (for Windows) setup remote access via RDP, SSH or otherwise.</p> <p>CONGRATULATIONS!
